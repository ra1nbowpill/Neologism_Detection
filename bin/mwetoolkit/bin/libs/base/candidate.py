        A MWE candidate is a sequence of words extracted from the corpus. The
        sequence of words has a base form ngram (generally lemmas) and a list of
        occurrence ngrams. Features may me added to the candidate, such as 
        Association Measures. The candidate also might be evaluated as a True
        Positive according to several gold standards (references) so it also 
        contains a list of TP judgements.

            A base form is generally a non-inflected sequence of lemmas (unless
            you specified to consider surface forms instead of lemmas)

           @param occurs List of `Ngram`s that represent all the different 
           occurrences of this candidate. It is possible to find different
           occurrences when, for instance, several inflections are employed to
           a verb inside the candidate, but all these inflections correspond to
           a single lemma or base form of the verb.

           bigrams of this candidate.

           sense of Machine Learning features. A feature is a pair name-value
           and can be an Association Measure, linguistic information, etc.
           
           @param tpclasses List of `TPClass`es that represent an evaluation of
           the candidate. It can correspond, for example, to a list of human
           judgements about it being or not a MWE. The class is probably boolean
           but multiclass values are allowed, as long as the concerned machine
           learning algorithm can deal with it.

           variations may be used to validade different syntactic configurations
           in the Web or in a corpus. For more information, take a look at the
           variation entropy measure suggested in the paper "Picking them up
           and Figuring them out" that we published in CoNLL 2008.
